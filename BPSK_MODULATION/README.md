# BPSK Modulation using MATLAB

## Objective
To simulate a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) digital communication system and analyze the effect of noise.

## Theory
BPSK is a digital modulation technique where:
- Binary 1 is represented as +1
- Binary 0 is represented as −1

Demodulation is performed using zero-threshold detection.

## Methodology
- Generated random binary data
- Applied BPSK modulation
- Added AWGN noise
- Demodulated the received signal
- Calculated Bit Error Rate (BER)

## Results
Noise affects symbol detection and increases BER.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB (MATLAB Online)
