# MATLAB ECE Mini Projects :

This repository contains MATLAB-based mini projects demonstrating core **Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE)** concepts through simulation and analysis.

## Projects Included

### 1. Sampling Theorem Verification
- Demonstrates under-sampling, Nyquist sampling, and over-sampling
- Visualizes aliasing effects using discrete-time stem plots
- Core concepts: Sampling theorem, discrete signals, aliasing

 Folder: `Sampling-theorem/`
